       " \"i wish tripadvisor had 1 2 stars for our use because i would have given this a 2 1 2   3 is too high  this was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our napa pacific coast vacation, so i have a lot to compare it to  i have many other reviews on this site and i try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at having said that     it was my first experience at a best western brand and if this is a plus property i would not want to stay at a non plus one i disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews   this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area  who are you comparing yourself with when comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range  you are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison  it's like comparing apples and oranges   both fruits but there are many different qualities  now back to the property    don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name  this is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants  if that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution cons    the pool's capacity is 8 people  that should tell you something about the size  i'd guess it's 8x10' (that's probably a generous estimate)  in my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial  the balcony we had was so closed in and dark  the solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great    we looked out over denny's roof and a traffic light  oh, dennys  sigh     went our first 2 mornings  ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage  getting a hot entree i guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch  my husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it  there were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all  the tea water was luke warm at best  total waste of my time location   not your romantic getaway place by any means  about 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of napa's wine country depending on traffic  in hinesight i would not have booked this hotel if not for the many( now suspicious in my mind)   reviews  i find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best  really after spending 3 days in napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, i question the validity of these raving reviews pros    yes there are a few   i promised a fair review and that's what i deliver shower    best shower head of any hotel  in fact i'm looking for one for my own shower cleanliness    our room was very clean  small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet  microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience bed pillows    very comfortable so if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel  if you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool   don't book this property  at most i would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities  all the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when i'm there  they need to charge accordingly we paid 537 for saturday, sunday and monday evenings  i now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property  oh well, live and learn thank you for your detailed review  first, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property  each hotel will have their pluses and minuses  we also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market  we actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of napa, further away from the vineyards  on average you would have paid between 75  200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel all best westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from aaa have the opportunity to be a plus property as long as they have a pip( property improvement plan) in place  with the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete  there is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines  our rates are similar to last years (before plus) and we have added breakfast at dennys and many more amenities  we never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184)  there are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites  when a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool  we recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool as for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in napa  we are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve  tripadvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower
